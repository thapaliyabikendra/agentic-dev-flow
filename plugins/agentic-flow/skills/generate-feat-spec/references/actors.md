# Reference: Actor nodes

An Actor is a human role or a named system trigger that initiates or receives behavior in this feature. Actors are consumed by the Permissions Map and cross-referenced by every Command, Query, and Flow.

> **Enforcement:** A bare `System` actor is not permitted. `System:` actors must name a specific background job, scheduled task, or distributed event handler.

---

## When to create an Actor

Create an Actor when a clause identifies a distinct participant with:

- A business role with distinct authorization needs (human actor), or
- A named system trigger that executes work outside a user request (system actor).

Do **not** create:

- Generic `User` actors when the clause names a specific role (create `Customer`, `Reviewer`, `ComplianceOfficer`, etc.).
- A bare `System` actor for ordinary system-initiated domain logic — that belongs inside the triggering Command or Flow.
- Duplicate actors for the same business role under different wordings (e.g., "admin" and "administrator" are one actor).

## Actor kinds

| Kind | Example name | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Human | `Customer`, `Reviewer`, `ComplianceOfficer` | A user interacting through the UI or API |
| External system | `PartnerCreditBureau`, `StripeWebhook` | A named external service that calls the API |
| System: BackgroundJob | `System: BackgroundJob: EmailReminderJob` | An ABP background job that executes deferred work |
| System: ScheduledTask | `System: ScheduledTask: DailyReportGenerator` | An ABP-hosted scheduler |
| System: EventHandler | `System: EventHandler: PaymentReceivedHandler` | A distributed event subscriber |

## Required fields

### Conceptual Actor (Kind: Human or External system)

Every Conceptual Actor entry must include these bold-labeled fields:

- `**Node type:** Actor`
- `**Name:** <PascalCase>`
- `**Kind:** Human | External system`
- `**ABP identity binding:** <IdentityUser + role <RoleName>> or <external system identifier>`
- `**Goals:** <bullet list, one short goal per line, drawn from clause content>`
- `**Commands initiated:** <bullet list of wiki links to Command pages, or "none">`
- `**Queries initiated:** <bullet list of wiki links to Query pages, or "none">`
- `**Source:** <bullet list of GitLab section-anchor deep links; see SKILL.md Clause Source Deep-Linking>`

**Do NOT include** `Inherits from:` or `Base class:` on Conceptual Actors. These fields have no meaning for a business role or external system — rendering `Base class: N/A` is a defect.

Optional fields (include only if clauses support them):

- `**Responsibilities:** <bullet list of broader responsibilities beyond initiated commands/queries>`
- `**Notifications received:** <bullet list of domain/integration events this actor is notified about>`
- `**Constraints:** <bullet list — e.g., "can only act within their own tenant scope">`

---

### System Actor (Kind: BackgroundJob / ScheduledTask / EventHandler)

Every System Actor entry must include these bold-labeled fields:

- `**Node type:** Actor`
- `**Name:** System: <Kind>: <JobName>` (e.g., `System: BackgroundJob: EmailReminderJob`)
- `**Kind:** System: BackgroundJob | System: ScheduledTask | System: EventHandler`
- `**ABP identity binding:** <concrete C# class name: the job class, scheduler class, or event handler class>`
- `**Goals:** <bullet list, one short goal per line, drawn from clause content>`
- `**Commands initiated:** <bullet list of wiki links to Command pages, or "none">`
- `**Queries initiated:** <bullet list of wiki links to Query pages, or "none">`
- `**Source:** <bullet list of GitLab section-anchor deep links; see SKILL.md Clause Source Deep-Linking>`

Optional fields:

- `**Implementation class:** <fully-qualified class name if known at spec time>`
- `**Notifications received:** <bullet list of domain/integration events this actor is notified about>`

## ABP identity binding

For human actors, bind to ABP Identity using the form `IdentityUser + role <RoleName>`. The `<RoleName>` corresponds to an `IdentityRole` to be seeded via `IDataSeedContributor` or configured in `{Module}PermissionDefinitionProvider` role mapping.

For system actors, bind to a concrete C# class name: the background job class (`EmailReminderJob`), the scheduled task class, or the event handler class. The exact class is declared in the Integration entry or in the ABP Artifact Map's Application section.

For external systems, bind to a descriptive identifier that matches how the system authenticates (e.g., `ApiKey: partner-credit-bureau-v1`, `OAuth2Client: stripe-webhook`).

---

## Goals

Goals capture *why* the actor is in this feature, not *how*. One short line per goal. Draw directly from clause content — if no clause says why the actor is involved, the goal list is suspect and the actor should be reconsidered.

Examples:

- Customer
  - Submit a registration request.
  - Verify their email address.
  - View the status of their own requests.
- Reviewer
  - Review pending registrations assigned to their team.
  - Approve or reject within the defined SLA.
- System: BackgroundJob: EmailReminderJob
  - Send a reminder email 48 hours after a request is submitted if still unverified.

---

## Commands and Queries initiated

Link to the Command and Query wiki pages using `[<Name>](<wiki_url>/commands/<Name>)` and `[<Name>](<wiki_url>/queries/<Name>)` — full URL form, no `.md`, no `wiki_local_path` prefix, human-readable label. The Permissions Map is generated from these relationships — every link here creates a row in the Permissions Map.

If an actor has no initiated Commands or Queries (pure observer or notification target), write `**Commands initiated:** none` and `**Queries initiated:** none`, then record the observation relationship in `**Notifications received:**`.

## Example entry (reference only — follow format, do not copy content verbatim)

> **Node type:** Actor
> **Name:** Reviewer
> **Kind:** Human
> **ABP identity binding:** `IdentityUser` + role `Reviewer`
> **Goals:**
> - Review pending registration requests assigned to the reviewer's team.
> - Approve or reject each request within the 48-hour SLA.
> - See audit trail for each decision.
>
> **Commands initiated:**
> - [ApproveRegistrationRequest](<wiki_url>/commands/ApproveRegistrationRequest)
> - [RejectRegistrationRequest](<wiki_url>/commands/RejectRegistrationRequest)
>
> **Queries initiated:**
> - [ListPendingRegistrationRequests](<wiki_url>/queries/ListPendingRegistrationRequests)
> - [GetRegistrationRequest](<wiki_url>/queries/GetRegistrationRequest)
>
> **Constraints:**
> - Reviewer can only act on requests assigned to their team (`TeamId` scoping).
> - Reviewer cannot act on their own submitted requests (SubmitterUserId ≠ current user).

## Common defects

| Defect | Fix |
|---|---|
| Bare `System` actor with no job name | Rename to `System: BackgroundJob: <JobName>` or remove and fold behavior into the triggering Command |
| Actor with zero initiated Commands and Queries | Either move observer behavior to `**Notifications received:**`, or remove the actor entirely |
| Duplicate actors under different names | Merge; keep the most FRS-faithful name |
| Actor whose goals are implementation details (e.g., "calls the API") | Rewrite as business goal; keep implementation out of Actor entries |
| Human actor without `IdentityUser + role` binding | Add the binding; roles are required for the Permissions Map |
| Conceptual Actor (Human or External system) with `Base class: N/A` or `Inherits from:` field | Remove the field entirely — these fields are reserved for System Actors only |
